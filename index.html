                    Lionel Messi is known as the GOAT in football due to his skills and consistency. A key player for whatever team he plays and has over 800 career goals and more than 350 assists making him the only player in history to achieve these milestones. He is like no other and shows his dominance with his World Cup Win in 2022 and Copa America win in 2024.
